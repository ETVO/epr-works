# 💼 EPR Works - Professional Portfolio & Résumé

A modern, minimalist portfolio website showcasing professional experience, projects, and creative work. Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS for a clean, performant single-page application experience.

**Live Site:** [epr-works.pages.dev](https://epr-works.pages.dev)

## 🎯 Overview

This project serves as my professional portfolio and digital résumé, designed with a "sufficiently interesting and interestingly sufficient" philosophy. The minimalist approach prioritizes content and user experience while demonstrating modern web development capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Single-Page Application** - Smooth navigation with React Router for seamless browsing
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Portfolio Showcase** - Detailed project presentations with visual examples
- **Interactive Résumé** - Complete professional history in an elegant, readable format
- **Extras Section** - Personal creative projects and artistic endeavors
- **Modern Stack** - React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS 4 for optimal performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js 19** - Component-based UI with modern hooks and patterns
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive styling
- **React Router 7** - Client-side routing for SPA navigation
- **Vite 7** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **SCSS** - Enhanced styling capabilities alongside Tailwind
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency enforcement

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Design proposal: very minimalistic, clean style. It's supposed to be sufficiently interesting—and interestingly sufficient. The design intentionally avoids over-styling to let content take center stage.

## 🎨 About the Stack Choice

### React.js
I enjoy working with React, as it allows for very modern web application development—making intuitive experiences achievable with fewer steps and better overall performance. Plus, the single-page style really adds a nice touch to it, doesn't it?

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is relatively new to me. The learning curve felt steep at first, but once it clicked, everything made sense. Most of my experience has been with Bootstrap, but Tailwind takes the utility-first approach to a whole new level—it just feels more fluid and expressive.

## 💻 Technical Highlights

This portfolio demonstrates expertise across multiple frameworks and paradigms. While this site showcases my frontend skills, I'm equally experienced in backend development with PHP—it's my go-to language, and I've developed tons of websites with it. I've also used JavaScript basically everywhere and every single time. JS is a marriage.

### Modern Frontend Development
- Component composition with React hooks
- Responsive-first design with Tailwind utilities
- Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- ESLint for consistent code quality

### Backend & WordPress Expertise
Beyond this portfolio, my WordPress development follows a structured approach:
- **Themes** - Custom site architecture with dynamic admin-configurable options
- **Gutenberg Blocks** - Reusable components with JSX editors and PHP rendering
- **OOP Architecture** - Clean organization and WordPress hook management
- **Auto-registration Systems** - Custom generators that reduce boilerplate code

The plugins I've developed extend websites with interesting functionality. In the "blocks" plugins, I create reusable blocks that can be easily edited in the WordPress Gutenberg editor (based on JSX), and then rendered on the public pages using PHP. They contain an interesting block-generation system that automatically registers blocks and their rendering logic—saving lots of time and lines of code.
