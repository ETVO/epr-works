# Hey!
Good to see you here!

## This project

A showcase of my professional portfolio, along with my detailed résumé and some extra information about my artistic projects.

It was developed using React.js with Vite. I enjoy working with React, as it allows for very modern web application development -- making intuitive experiences achievable with fewer steps and better overall performance. Plus, the single-page style really adds a nice touch to it, doesn't it?

Design proposal: very minimalistic, clean style. It's supposed to be sufficiently interesting -- and interestingly sufficient.

## Welcome to my GitHub.

You'll see many projects here. Some of them are based on PHP -- it's my go-to language, and I've developed tons of websites with it. I've also used JavaScript basically everywhere and every single time. JS is a marriage.

### WordPress

Let me introduce you to a crowd: the projects that end in “-theme” or “-blocks” are themes and plugins I’ve developed for WordPress.

Basically, the themes set up how the website is going to work, how we'll process the content the administrators put on the site, and how it will be beautifully displayed. There we can also set up standard layouts -- like header, footer, and page views -- along with customizable options that can be dynamically updated by admins anytime they want.

The plugins, on the other hand, are supposed to extend the website with interesting functionality. In the "blocks" plugins I developed, I’d create reusable blocks that can be easily edited in the WordPress Gutenberg editor (based on JSX), and then rendered on the public pages using PHP. They contain an interesting block-generation system that automatically registers blocks and their rendering logic -- saving lots of time and lines of code.

Oh, and my default approach for developing these themes and plugins became OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). It made everything so much better organized, allowed for clear management of WordPress hooks and actions -- and honestly, it just looks better.

### Worth noting

Here are some projects I think you'll like to check out:

- [velozcf](https://github.com/ETVO/velozcf): a full-featured, highly customized sales application built with React.js and PHP -- here I developed a custom REST API and also integrated seamlessly with an external one.  
- [etvo-manage](https://github.com/ETVO/etvo-manage): a CMS I developed for my own website back in the day. Mostly PHP -- and I had a lot of fun with it.  
- [femai-theme](https://github.com/ETVO/femai-theme) & [femai-blocks](https://github.com/ETVO/femai-blocks): good examples of WordPress work I’ve done.  
- [tourdocs](https://github.com/ETVO/tourdocs): a neat Vue.js app I built for tourism operators in Foz do Iguaçu -- they use it to manage info and generate PDFs.  
- [epr-works](https://github.com/ETVO/epr-works): yes! You read it right!
